# aether
A tiny weather monitor using Wunderground's API
Similar to [wu](https://github.com/sramsay/wu), but (maybe) written in C and using [jsmn](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn/).
# why
I wanted to build my own weather monitor as a coding exercise and so that I could set up notifications on my computer based on the weather.
